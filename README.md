### Analysis of factors affecting student performance

This project focuses on analyzing the factors that affect student performance, particularly the relationship between study habits and academic success. Using a fictional dataset, we simulate the study hours and grades of 100 students to explore how these variables are correlated.

Project Overview
The analysis includes the following:

Data Simulation: A dataset is generated using random values for students' grades and their average study hours per week. This provides a simple yet effective way to simulate a scenario of student performance.
Correlation Calculation: We calculate the correlation between average study hours and grades, which helps us understand how closely these two factors are related.
Data Visualization: The project uses Seaborn and Matplotlib to create a regression plot showing the relationship between study hours and grades, with a trend line that highlights the correlation.
Key Features
Simulated Data: The data includes 100 students, with randomly generated grades (between 50 and 100) and study hours (between 1 and 20 hours per week).
Correlation Analysis: The script calculates the Pearson correlation coefficient between study hours and grades to quantify their relationship.
Visual Representation: A regression plot is generated, visually representing the correlation between the two factors.
Requirements
Python 3.x
Pandas
Numpy
Matplotlib
Seaborn

Usage:
To run the analysis, execute the student_performance_analysis.py script. This will generate the dataset, calculate the correlation, and display the regression plot.Ð•
